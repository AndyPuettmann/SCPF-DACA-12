## Title
* **Date:** 17/04/2021
* **Researcher:** Tom
* SCP 079
Asked me to push one of his wires into place, why not
He was polite about it, I'd imagine it was quite embarrassing for him (her? it? it's a TV)
Upon further inspection, instant death
This may have been from calling him "she" (though this observation may also be confirmation bias), definitely will use male prnouns for the forseeable future
