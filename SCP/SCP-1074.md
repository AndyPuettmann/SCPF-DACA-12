* **Researcher:** Tom
SCP 1074 
I am extremely annoyed by SCP 1074, because it's working exactly as intended. As soon as I looked at it, after a few seconds of not moving I just keep walking directly 
towards it. Very detrimental to other research. Looked kinda nice though, I suppose. Oh, and I didn't die. After like 3 minutes the walking stopped.
