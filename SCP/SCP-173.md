## Recontainment
There are 2 efective ways of recontainment. First one is to push it, 2 people at least (but about 4 are recomended) are needed to succesfully compleate this recontainment strategy. You need to push it, one person pushes it and the rest looks at it, there is quite a large chance that the person pushing will die. The second way is by luring, 1 person is enough but 2 are recomended. For this to work you need to be far enough so it doesnt kill you, but close enough that it gets trigered by you looking away. Look away for about half a second it will come to you without killing you (Hopefully). An example of the strategy is shown here:
