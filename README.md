Welcome to The SCPF Foundation. Here at the Foundation we focus on protecting mankind from extremely dangerous objects and anomalies. In our Facility we house a large number of SCP's ranging from Safe to Keter to study and perform tests on aswell as secure, contain and protect them. The information we gather from these objects and anomalies will be used to aid mankind and in preventing an outbreak of these SCP's, or stopping an outbreak as soon as possible.
