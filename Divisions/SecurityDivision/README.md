# Code of Security:

Class - D/C/E Termination will only occur when the Class - D/C/E is miss-behaving (e.g Continuously crossing the Red Lined Area or Shooting their weapon at other Class - D/C/E or any other Personnel). Class - D/C/E personnel will be issued with ONE warning if they cross the line, if they cross again, you are able to Terminate the Class - D/C/E that was doing this. If the Class - D/C/E has been Terminated more than THREE times, you are able to put the Class - D/C/E inside of Solitary Confinement.

During a Breach, Security Department are only allowed to assist Mobile Task Force with Re Containing if there are under THREE MTF units on Site, if there are more than THREE MTF units on Site and more than FOUR SD operatives on Site, TWO must stay inside the Breach Shelter and the other TWO must lockdown the corridor from wandering Personnel.
Security Department members may also assist in re-containment if additional backup is requested by MTF.

Foundation Personnel are only to be Terminated if they are Breaching, Assaulting another Personnel, not going to the Breach Shelter during a breach or raid or leaving via Gate - A without proper clearence.

During a Chaos Insurgency raid, Security Department should post at either - unless CI are already inside or too many CI or too little SD to hold these positions;
CI-1
CI-2.
If there are more than THREE Chaos Insurgency operatives, Security must escort all Foundation Personnel to the Breach Shelter and Lock it down with ONE/TWO Security Department operatives inside the Breach Shelter.
