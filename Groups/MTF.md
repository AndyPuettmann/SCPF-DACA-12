Mobile Task Forces are elite units comprised of personnel drawn from across the Foundation and are mobilized to deal with specific threats or situations that sometimes exceed operational capacity or expertise of regular field personnel and — as their name suggests — may be relocated between facilities or locations as they are needed. Mobile Task Force personnel represent the "best of the best" of the Foundation.

Epsilon-11 are one of the most Elite task forces inside the facility, they are first in command during a Breach, and are fourth in command during a Chaos Insurgency Raid.

Alpha-1 'Red Right Hand'
Alpha-1 are in charge of protecting unarmed Level - 4+ personnel. Alpha-1 are able to patrol the Facility if there is no Level - 4+ personnel or any Chaos Insurgency. If there is no Level - 4+ personnel and there is Chaos Insurgency, Alpha-1 will assist Epsilon-11 and Nu-7 with defending the Facility. While Alpha-1 are protecting high value personnel they hold authority over other MTF units, otherwise they are second in command during a raid and third in command during a breach.

Beta-7 'Maz Hatters'
Beta-7 are experts in biological and radilogical hazards, meaning they are second in command during a breach and third in command during a raid. When there are no Breaches or Chaos Insurgency online, Beta-7 assist with Testing to ensure no breaches occur. If there is Chaos Insurgency online, Beta-7 will hold back inside Sector - 2, waiting near the Airlock, until Chaos enter Sector - 2.

If there is a breach, Nu-7 lock down the Sector, making sure all Foundation Personnel are inside the breach Shelter, they may be called for backup in re-containing if needed.
